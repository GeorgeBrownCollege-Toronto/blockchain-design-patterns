# Token basics 

Token basics is just a group of interfaces and contracts for tokens to meet the ERC20 standard. 
Simply inherit the newly created token form these contracts to have full ERC20 standard functionality. 
Note that what ever token you are deriving from these still needs to implimnet the tokens name, short name and number of decimals at the very least.
