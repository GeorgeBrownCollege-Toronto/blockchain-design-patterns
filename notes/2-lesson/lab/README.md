## Escrow Lab (with front-end and backend)

* This lab is continuation of the [previous](../../1-lesson/lab/README.md) lab.
* Create very minimal front-end which :
    * Allows only `Sender` to deposit fund to the Escrow contract
    * Allows only `Receiver` to withdraw fund from the Escrow contract
    * Displays the amount of fund the smart contract holds
    * Time (in blocks) left for `Receiver` to withdraw funds from the Escrow.

## Mandatory Submission Requirements
* Front-end framework : ReactJS / NextJs
* MetaMask wallet integration : [@metamask/onboarding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/onboarding) / [web3-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3-react)
* Commit above changes to the repository created in [previous](../../1-lesson/lab/README.md) lab.
> Include secret files in `.gitignore` so that they are not committed to your private GitHub repo.
* Submit the private GitHub repository url + front-end screenshots to BB as a part of submission.
> Make sure to provide read access to @dhruvinparikh if you have not done in previous lab
